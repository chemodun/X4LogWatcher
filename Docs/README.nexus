[size=3][u][b]Known Issues[/b][/u][/size]

In some cases, the application may not detect changes in the log file. If this happens, you can enable the "Forced refresh" mode in the menu. This will force the application to check for changes in the log file at regular intervals.

Will work in case if any [b]watch mode[/b] is enabled.
