# X4 Log Watcher

X4 Log Watcher is a simple tool to monitor the log files of X4: Foundations. It provides a graphical interface to view and filter log entries, making it easier to analyze the game's output.

## Features

- Real-time log monitoring
- Filter log entries by regular expressions
- Multi-tabbed interface for filtering the same log file
- Enable/disable filters on the fly per each tab
- Watch not only the exact log file but also the parent directory to reload the log file when new log files are created
- Support profiles saving and loading - i.e. current tabs with filters
- Offline mode - i.e. load the log file from disk and parse it
- Loading default profile on startup
- Support a "Forced refresh" mode, if by some reason standard Windows file watcher doesn't work
- Support simple text search in current filtered content via Ctrl+F and F3(Enter)/Shift+F3 for next/previous search result
- Has a status bar with the current log file name and it's stats. Additionally shows the loading progress of the log file in the offline mode
- Shows the updates in non-focused tabs via adding the notification symbol "ðŸ””" to the tab name
- Can show up to 10 lines after the matched line in the log file. Useful for showing the error details in the scripts
- Extension for the log file is configurable via editing of the config file. By default, it is set to `.log`

## Known Issues

In some cases, the application may not detect changes in the log file. If this happens, you can enable the "Forced refresh" mode in the menu. This will force the application to check for changes in the log file at regular intervals.

Will work in case if any `watch mode` is enabled.
